\title{Discretize Multilines in a Roadway Network}
\usage{
st_discretize_multilines(
  network_object,
  section_length_threshold,
  input_crs,
  segmentation_length
)
}
\arguments{
\item{network_object}{A spatial object of class `sf` representing the roadway network. It should contain a geometry column and attributes such as corridor names.}

\item{section_length_threshold}{Numeric. A length threshold in meters. Sections shorter than this threshold will be removed from processing.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
  \describe{
    \item{\code{temp_segemented_links_seg_ordered}}{An `sf` object with the segmented network, including attributes for section IDs, segment order, and lengths.}
    \item{\code{cor_section_summary}}{A data frame summarizing each corridor, including total lengths, number of sections, and distance metrics.}
  }
}
\description{
This function processes a spatial object representing a roadway network, breaking it into discrete segments for analysis. It identifies contiguous sections within named corridors, orders links within these sections, and further segments them into 10-meter long units. The function outputs an ordered and segmented representation of the network and summary statistics for each corridor.
}
\details{
The function performs the following steps:
1. Identifies contiguous sections of links within named corridors.
2. Removes sections shorter than the specified length threshold.
3. Orders links within each contiguous section for consistency.
4. Breaks links into 10-meter long segments and reorders them.
5. Computes summary statistics for each corridor, such as total length, shortest and longest sections, and distances between sections.

Note: This function assumes the input network is projected in a CRS (e.g., EPSG:32610) that supports distance measurement in meters.

# Load a sample network object
